# Flocking-Boids


It implements the **Flocking Boids algorithm.** This algorithm tries to simulate the behavior of large masses of individuals. It was originally based on the flapping of birds.

To implement this system I have used C ++, and the SFML library, to create the execution window.

Here we have two GIFs that show the general behavior. In the first one you can see how different individuals interact. The second shows how they avoid the position of the mouse.
